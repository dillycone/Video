Create a VERBATIM transcript of the video, capturing every word exactly as spoken.
This must be a word-for-word transcription, not a summary.

Requirements:
1. Include [HH:MM:SS] timestamps for:
   - Every speaker change
   - Sound effects or background noises

2. Format:
   - Each line must start with a timestamp
   - Capture EXACT words, including:

     * Filler words (um, uh, like)
     * False starts and corrections
     * Repeated words
     * Incomplete sentences

   - Include non-verbal sounds in parentheses
   - Identify speakers when possible

Example format:
[00:00:05] Speaker: Um, what I was trying to say is... uh... let me start over.
[00:00:08] (Pause)
[00:00:10] Speaker: The thing about this new product is...
[00:00:15] (dog barking)
[00:00:17] Speaker: Actually, let me show you instead.

DO NOT summarize or paraphrase. Transcribe exactly what is said, word for word.
